Volts across led: 2,5 V 
	With a 10K resistance and driven through the 2n3904 (100KOhm base to gpio)


With USB 5V directly fed, the relay coil consumes 70mA
	The pico restarts everytime te coil de-energizes, the diode requirement is
	real.

Had to replace the 100K base resistor with a 10K because with the realy coil
current I guess the transistor couldn't remain polarized.
